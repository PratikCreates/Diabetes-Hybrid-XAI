# Outputs Directory

This directory contains all generated outputs from the diabetes prediction ensemble model.

## Structure

### `imgs/` - Visualizations
- `model_performance_comparison.png` - Bar charts comparing Accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F1-scores across all models
- `feature_importance_comparison.png` - Feature importance rankings from Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models
- `calibration_curves.png` - Calibration curves showing probability calibration for all models
- `confusion_matrices.png` - Confusion matrices for Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Ensemble models

### `results/` - Data Files
- `model_performance_metrics.csv` - Complete performance metrics for all models
- `feature_importance.csv` - Feature importance rankings and scores
- `detailed_results.json` - Full experimental results in JSON format including:
  - Individual model metrics
  - Feature importance data
  - Ensemble model coefficients
  - Dataset information
  - Performance summary

## Usage

These files can be used to:
- Analyze model performance trends
- Understand feature importance
- Reproduce results
- Generate reports and presentations

## Generated By

The outputs are generated by running:
```bash
python src/diabetes_prediction_simplified.py
